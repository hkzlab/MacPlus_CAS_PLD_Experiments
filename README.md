# MacPlus CAS PLD Experiments

**WARNING**: Work in progress, do not use unless you know what you're doing! :)

## Introduction

As far as I know, the dumps for the CAS PLD (a PAL 20L8) on the Macintosh Plus that are floating around the net are problematic with some memory configurations.

I fiddled with the equations without having an PLD on hand, to try and get all the memory configurations working (4x 256KB, 2x 1MB, 2x 1MB + 2x 256KB, 4x 1MB). The JEDs 
found here are working fine on my Mac Plus clone, but I have at least one report from someone with another clone that, while the machine boots, audio is garbled.

As such, if you try these JEDs, please report back how they work for you!

In the meantime, I'm waiting for an original Plus motherboard to arrive so I can compare the behavior of the original PLD with the equations found in the ones from this repo.
